# Mastermind-Python-Game
This game was created using Python only as my final project for my first year for the subject CSC1024 Programming Principles.

Basically, this game will produce a random colour pattern and the user have few chances to guess the correct pattern. If the user can guess the correct pattern, they win the game.
